# -- Set to 'True' to load all Uformer models into VRAM on FastAPI server startup.
# This offers the best performance but uses more VRAM initially.
# -- Set to 'False' to load models on-demand as they are requested.
# This saves VRAM, but the first request for a model will be slower.
# Once a model is loaded on-demand, it will be cached in VRAM until the server is
# restarted or the "Clear All Models" button is used in the UI.
